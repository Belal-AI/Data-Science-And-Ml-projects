He's facing eviction from his home, and his wife has just left him. Maleni feels helpless and doesn't know where to turn.\\n\\nMaleni: I don't know what to do. I'm facing eviction from my home, and my wife has just left me.\\nFriend: I'm so sorry to hear that, Maleni. What can I do to help you?\\nMaleni: I don't know. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I've been working at the same job for 30 years, and now they've laid me off. My wife was the breadwinner, and she's just left me. I don't know how I'm going to make it on my own.\\nFriend: Let's start with your housing situation. Do you have somewhere to stay if you're evicted from your home?\\nMaleni: No, not really. My son is in college, and my daughter is away at work most of the time. I suppose I could stay with them, but I really don't want to impose on them like that.\\nFriend: Okay, well let's look into some other options then. Have you considered moving in with a relative or friend? Maybe they would be willing to help you out until you get back on your feet again.\\nMaleni: No, nobody that I know would be able to take me in right now. Everybody's got their own problems they're dealing with right now - nobody needs another mouth to feed so to speak. But thank you for thinking of that anyway - it was very kind of you.\\\"\\nFriend: You're welcome. Okay, well let's try to brainstorm some other solutions then. Have you applied for any government assistance or unemployment benefits?\\nMaleni: Yes, I've applied for both of those things. But I haven't heard back about the government assistance yet, and my unemployment benefits have been denied because they say I wasn't laid off due to lack of work. They said it was a \\\"reduction in workforce\\\" so I don't qualify.\\nFriend: That doesn't seem right. Do you have anyone you can talk to about that? Maybe an attorney or someone who knows more about those kinds of things?\\nMaleni: No, I don't really know anyone who would be able to help me with that kind of thing. And even if I did, I don't have the money to pay them for their help.\\nFriend: Well, maybe we can look into that too and see if there are any pro bono options available or something like that. In the meantime, have you thought about looking for another job?\\nMaleni: Yeah, I've been sending out resumes left and right but nobody's hiring right now - especially not someone my age. And even if they were hiring, a lot of these jobs require skills that I just don't have.\\\"\\nFriend: Hmm...well maybe we can look into some training programs or something like that too then. There might be some funding available to help you get the training you need so you can qualify for these jobs.\\nMaleni: Yeah...I guess it couldn't hurt to look into that too...I'm just feeling so overwhelmed right now and like everything is working against me.\\nFriend: Hey, it's going to be okay - we'll figure something out together. Let's just take things one step at a time and not try to do everything all at once, okay? We'll start with finding a place for you to stay so you're not worried about being homeless and go from there.\\\"\\n<end of reference>\\nTask:\\nWhich of the following words best describes the emotional state of Maleni in this conversation?

You do them every day without giving them much thought. Yet, what happens inside your body after you eat is complex. The digestive process pulls out the energy you need to function, and then gets rid of what\\u2019s left behind.\\nWhen you chew and swallow, a well-orchestrated chain of events takes place inside your body that you are not aware of. Peristalsis is an involuntary muscular action that pushes food through your digestive system. It's an important part of the digestive process. If you were to watch this process on an X-ray, it would almost look like an ocean wave pushing food from one organ to the next. In the first step of this journey, food moves down your food pipe (esophagus). This takes it from your throat to your stomach.\\n\\nThe gateway to your stomach is called the lower esophageal sphincter. This ring-like muscle opens and closes the passage between your esophagus and your stomach, as needed. During the digestive process, the sphincter relaxes and lets food pass into your stomach.\\nFood goes through a significant part of the digestive process inside your stomach. You may think of your stomach as a simple pouch. But it\\u2019s actually much tougher than other organs in your body. For example, the digestive juices and enzymes that your stomach makes to break down food could dissolve most of the other organs in your body. Your stomach contains a thick mucous lining that prevents these strong juices from eating through its walls.\\nThe stomach is also very flexible. When your most recent meal first enters your stomach, the upper part relaxes and expands. This lets your stomach hold and process a large amount of food and liquid.\\nDuring digestion, muscles push food from the upper part of your stomach to the lower part. This is where the real action begins. This is where digestive juices and enzymes break down the food that you chewed and swallowed. It prepares it to provide your body with energy.\\nThe stomach makes several digestive juices and enzymes that mix with food. Next, the stomach\\u2019s strong muscles act like a blender to turn food into a useable form.\\nThis process takes longer for some types of foods than others. Carbohydrates, for example, break down the fastest. This explains why many recommend carb-heavy foods for a quick energy boost. Proteins take longer to digest and exit the stomach. Fats take the longest time of all. Zero-calorie liquids, such as water, empty the fastest from the stomach.\\n\\nOnce the stomach completes its role in the digestive process, its contents slowly pass into a short tube at the base of the stomach. This is called the duodenum. It's the first part of the small intestine. Here the next stage of digestion takes place. Digestive juices produced in organs, such as the liver and pancreas, continue the process of turning food into energy.\\n<end of reference>\\nInstruction:\\nHere is an article on how we digest our food, read and analyze the text to answer the question.\\n\\nDoes the content of the text do a good job fully explaining the digestion process? If not, explain why.\\n\\nUse pieces from the article to support your answer and include examples if the structure does not contribute to the message.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tup\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chosen\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4459,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The author's perspective on wealth and its impact on society is reflected in this poem through a tone of resentment and envy towards those who have it.

He's facing eviction from his home, and his wife has just left him. Maleni feels helpless and doesn't know where to turn.\\n\\nMaleni: I don't know what to do. I'm facing eviction from my home, and my wife has just left me.\\nFriend: I'm so sorry to hear that, Maleni. What can I do to help you?\\nMaleni: I don't know. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I've been working at the same job for 30 years, and now they've laid me off. My wife was the breadwinner, and she's just left me. I don't know how I'm going to make it on my own.\\nFriend: Let's start with your housing situation. Do you have somewhere to stay if you're evicted from your home?\\nMaleni: No, not really. My son is in college, and my daughter is away at work most of the time. I suppose I could stay with them, but I really don't want to impose on them like that.\\nFriend: Okay, well let's look into some other options then. Have you considered moving in with a relative or friend? Maybe they would be willing to help you out until you get back on your feet again.\\nMaleni: No, nobody that I know would be able to take me in right now. Everybody's got their own problems they're dealing with right now - nobody needs another mouth to feed so to speak. But thank you for thinking of that anyway - it was very kind of you.\\\"\\nFriend: You're welcome. Okay, well let's try to brainstorm some other solutions then. Have you applied for any government assistance or unemployment benefits?\\nMaleni: Yes, I've applied for both of those things. But I haven't heard back about the government assistance yet, and my unemployment benefits have been denied because they say I wasn't laid off due to lack of work. They said it was a \\\"reduction in workforce\\\" so I don't qualify.\\nFriend: That doesn't seem right. Do you have anyone you can talk to about that? Maybe an attorney or someone who knows more about those kinds of things?\\nMaleni: No, I don't really know anyone who would be able to help me with that kind of thing. And even if I did, I don't have the money to pay them for their help.\\nFriend: Well, maybe we can look into that too and see if there are any pro bono options available or something like that. In the meantime, have you thought about looking for another job?\\nMaleni: Yeah, I've been sending out resumes left and right but nobody's hiring right now - especially not someone my age. And even if they were hiring, a lot of these jobs require skills that I just don't have.\\\"\\nFriend: Hmm...well maybe we can look into some training programs or something like that too then. There might be some funding available to help you get the training you need so you can qualify for these jobs.\\nMaleni: Yeah...I guess it couldn't hurt to look into that too...I'm just feeling so overwhelmed right now and like everything is working against me.\\nFriend: Hey, it's going to be okay - we'll figure something out together. Let's just take things one step at a time and not try to do everything all at once, okay? We'll start with finding a place for you to stay so you're not worried about being homeless and go from there.\\\"\\n<end of reference>\\nTask:\\nWhich of the following words best describes the emotional state of Maleni in this conversation?

You do them every day without giving them much thought. Yet, what happens inside your body after you eat is complex. The digestive process pulls out the energy you need to function, and then gets rid of what\\u2019s left behind.\\nWhen you chew and swallow, a well-orchestrated chain of events takes place inside your body that you are not aware of. Peristalsis is an involuntary muscular action that pushes food through your digestive system. It's an important part of the digestive process. If you were to watch this process on an X-ray, it would almost look like an ocean wave pushing food from one organ to the next. In the first step of this journey, food moves down your food pipe (esophagus). This takes it from your throat to your stomach.\\n\\nThe gateway to your stomach is called the lower esophageal sphincter. This ring-like muscle opens and closes the passage between your esophagus and your stomach, as needed. During the digestive process, the sphincter relaxes and lets food pass into your stomach.\\nFood goes through a significant part of the digestive process inside your stomach. You may think of your stomach as a simple pouch. But it\\u2019s actually much tougher than other organs in your body. For example, the digestive juices and enzymes that your stomach makes to break down food could dissolve most of the other organs in your body. Your stomach contains a thick mucous lining that prevents these strong juices from eating through its walls.\\nThe stomach is also very flexible. When your most recent meal first enters your stomach, the upper part relaxes and expands. This lets your stomach hold and process a large amount of food and liquid.\\nDuring digestion, muscles push food from the upper part of your stomach to the lower part. This is where the real action begins. This is where digestive juices and enzymes break down the food that you chewed and swallowed. It prepares it to provide your body with energy.\\nThe stomach makes several digestive juices and enzymes that mix with food. Next, the stomach\\u2019s strong muscles act like a blender to turn food into a useable form.\\nThis process takes longer for some types of foods than others. Carbohydrates, for example, break down the fastest. This explains why many recommend carb-heavy foods for a quick energy boost. Proteins take longer to digest and exit the stomach. Fats take the longest time of all. Zero-calorie liquids, such as water, empty the fastest from the stomach.\\n\\nOnce the stomach completes its role in the digestive process, its contents slowly pass into a short tube at the base of the stomach. This is called the duodenum. It's the first part of the small intestine. Here the next stage of digestion takes place. Digestive juices produced in organs, such as the liver and pancreas, continue the process of turning food into energy.\\n<end of reference>\\nInstruction:\\nHere is an article on how we digest our food, read and analyze the text to answer the question.\\n\\nDoes the content of the text do a good job fully explaining the digestion process? If not, explain why.\\n\\nUse pieces from the article to support your answer and include examples if the structure does not contribute to the message.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chosen_response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4459,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The author's perspective on wealth and its impact on society is reflected in this poem through a tone of resentment and envy towards those who have it.

He's facing eviction from his home, and his wife has just left him. Maleni feels helpless and doesn't know where to turn.\\n\\nMaleni: I don't know what to do. I'm facing eviction from my home, and my wife has just left me.\\nFriend: I'm so sorry to hear that, Maleni. What can I do to help you?\\nMaleni: I don't know. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I've been working at the same job for 30 years, and now they've laid me off. My wife was the breadwinner, and she's just left me. I don't know how I'm going to make it on my own.\\nFriend: Let's start with your housing situation. Do you have somewhere to stay if you're evicted from your home?\\nMaleni: No, not really. My son is in college, and my daughter is away at work most of the time. I suppose I could stay with them, but I really don't want to impose on them like that.\\nFriend: Okay, well let's look into some other options then. Have you considered moving in with a relative or friend? Maybe they would be willing to help you out until you get back on your feet again.\\nMaleni: No, nobody that I know would be able to take me in right now. Everybody's got their own problems they're dealing with right now - nobody needs another mouth to feed so to speak. But thank you for thinking of that anyway - it was very kind of you.\\\"\\nFriend: You're welcome. Okay, well let's try to brainstorm some other solutions then. Have you applied for any government assistance or unemployment benefits?\\nMaleni: Yes, I've applied for both of those things. But I haven't heard back about the government assistance yet, and my unemployment benefits have been denied because they say I wasn't laid off due to lack of work. They said it was a \\\"reduction in workforce\\\" so I don't qualify.\\nFriend: That doesn't seem right. Do you have anyone you can talk to about that? Maybe an attorney or someone who knows more about those kinds of things?\\nMaleni: No, I don't really know anyone who would be able to help me with that kind of thing. And even if I did, I don't have the money to pay them for their help.\\nFriend: Well, maybe we can look into that too and see if there are any pro bono options available or something like that. In the meantime, have you thought about looking for another job?\\nMaleni: Yeah, I've been sending out resumes left and right but nobody's hiring right now - especially not someone my age. And even if they were hiring, a lot of these jobs require skills that I just don't have.\\\"\\nFriend: Hmm...well maybe we can look into some training programs or something like that too then. There might be some funding available to help you get the training you need so you can qualify for these jobs.\\nMaleni: Yeah...I guess it couldn't hurt to look into that too...I'm just feeling so overwhelmed right now and like everything is working against me.\\nFriend: Hey, it's going to be okay - we'll figure something out together. Let's just take things one step at a time and not try to do everything all at once, okay? We'll start with finding a place for you to stay so you're not worried about being homeless and go from there.\\\"\\n<end of reference>\\nTask:\\nWhich of the following words best describes the emotional state of Maleni in this conversation?

You do them every day without giving them much thought. Yet, what happens inside your body after you eat is complex. The digestive process pulls out the energy you need to function, and then gets rid of what\\u2019s left behind.\\nWhen you chew and swallow, a well-orchestrated chain of events takes place inside your body that you are not aware of. Peristalsis is an involuntary muscular action that pushes food through your digestive system. It's an important part of the digestive process. If you were to watch this process on an X-ray, it would almost look like an ocean wave pushing food from one organ to the next. In the first step of this journey, food moves down your food pipe (esophagus). This takes it from your throat to your stomach.\\n\\nThe gateway to your stomach is called the lower esophageal sphincter. This ring-like muscle opens and closes the passage between your esophagus and your stomach, as needed. During the digestive process, the sphincter relaxes and lets food pass into your stomach.\\nFood goes through a significant part of the digestive process inside your stomach. You may think of your stomach as a simple pouch. But it\\u2019s actually much tougher than other organs in your body. For example, the digestive juices and enzymes that your stomach makes to break down food could dissolve most of the other organs in your body. Your stomach contains a thick mucous lining that prevents these strong juices from eating through its walls.\\nThe stomach is also very flexible. When your most recent meal first enters your stomach, the upper part relaxes and expands. This lets your stomach hold and process a large amount of food and liquid.\\nDuring digestion, muscles push food from the upper part of your stomach to the lower part. This is where the real action begins. This is where digestive juices and enzymes break down the food that you chewed and swallowed. It prepares it to provide your body with energy.\\nThe stomach makes several digestive juices and enzymes that mix with food. Next, the stomach\\u2019s strong muscles act like a blender to turn food into a useable form.\\nThis process takes longer for some types of foods than others. Carbohydrates, for example, break down the fastest. This explains why many recommend carb-heavy foods for a quick energy boost. Proteins take longer to digest and exit the stomach. Fats take the longest time of all. Zero-calorie liquids, such as water, empty the fastest from the stomach.\\n\\nOnce the stomach completes its role in the digestive process, its contents slowly pass into a short tube at the base of the stomach. This is called the duodenum. It's the first part of the small intestine. Here the next stage of digestion takes place. Digestive juices produced in organs, such as the liver and pancreas, continue the process of turning food into energy.\\n<end of reference>\\nInstruction:\\nHere is an article on how we digest our food, read and analyze the text to answer the question.\\n\\nDoes the content of the text do a good job fully explaining the digestion process? If not, explain why.\\n\\nUse pieces from the article to support your answer and include examples if the structure does not contribute to the message.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chosen_response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4459,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The author's perspective on wealth and its impact on society is reflected in this poem through a tone of resentment and envy towards those who have it.

They use phrases like \\\"made of money\\\" and \\\"sleeping on bags of it\\\" to portray the wealthy as frivolous and materialistic, and suggest that they take their wealth for granted. The speaker also suggests that the wealthy have an entitled and sheltered existence, with a \\\"summer house\\\" and expensive hobbies like golf and tennis. They also suggest that the wealthy are out of touch with reality, having never had to struggle or want for anything.
